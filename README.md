# AndrewNg-DeepLearning
Assignment code in Python for Andrew Ng's  (and DeepLearning.ai) Deep Learning course from Coursera

These notebooks can also be viewed outside the scope of the course as they contain pretty isolated implementations of different deep learning models. They will be very helpful for specific individual projects in the future in my opinion.
